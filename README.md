# crispria_ppi
intersecting selection pressure, growth-based CRISPRi/a data with existing PPIs to predict novel PPIs


v1

v2

v3

v4

v5

v6 only using the 3 weissman CRISPRi/a datasets to train the model

v7 multiplying rho's

v8 multiplying rho's not taking abs() value of them

got rid of sigmoid activation in output layer so predictions aren't binary but rather a scale.

v9 TO-DO: use Huttlin Compass scores rather than binary 0/1 binding no binding

get probabilities for all 20,000 protein coding genes

compare vs. primary DNA/protein sequence-based predictions
